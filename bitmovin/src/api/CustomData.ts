/**
 * The customData fields can be freely configured. The data sent through these fields can be used as a filter or as a breakdown to segment the data
 * according to your needs.
 * Common use-cases for customData are sending the app version used, a cross-domain or profile ID, to track viewers across different platforms, or
 * assigning a high-level content category to order content assets. But the options are more or less unlimited.
 *
 * In the dashboard, under the license settings, customData fields can be labeled according to your liking.
 *
 * Note: For customData field queries we allow a cardinality of maximum of 15,000 distinct values per customData field within the selected time-frame.
 * Each customData field has a limit of 160 characters and there are 5 customData Fields available for every subscription.
 * Additional customData fields can be activated, up to 50 in total. These additional fields may incur a cost depending on the type of data stored.
 * Please reach out to us via the support form in the dashboard if you'd like more information.
