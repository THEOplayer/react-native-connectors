# React Native THEOplayer DRM

The `@theoplayer/react-native-drm` package provides a set of connectors for [react-native-theoplayer](https://github.com/THEOplayer/react-native-theoplayer),
allowing playback of DRM-protected content.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @theoplayer/react-native-drm
```

## Usage

The connector needs to be registered to the `ContentProtectionRegistry`, providing both
`integrationId` and `keySystemId`:

```typescript
import { ContentProtectionRegistry } from 'react-native-theoplayer';
import { EzdrmFairplayContentProtectionIntegrationFactory } from 'react-native-theoplayer-drm';

ContentProtectionRegistry.registerContentProtectionIntegration(
  'ezdrm',   // integrationId
  'fairplay', // keySystemId
  new EzdrmFairplayContentProtectionIntegrationFactory()
);
```

The combination of both `integrationId` and `keySystemId` points the player towards the connector
for a specific source, in this case the `ezdrm` connector for `fairplay`:

```typescript
const source = {
  "sources": {
    "src": "<source_url>",
    "contentProtection": {
      "integration": "ezdrm",
      "fairplay": {
        "certificate": "<base64encoded_certificate>",
        "licenseAcquisitionURL": "<license_url>"
      },
    }
  }
};
```

## Connectors

The [THEOplayer DRM integrations repository](https://github.com/THEOplayer/samples-drm-integration)
contains a list of integrations for native Web, Android & iOS THEOplayer SDKs.

As the content protection API of `react-native-theoplayer` is very similar to that of
THEOplayer's native Web SDK, the available Web connectors can mostly be reused as-is.
These connectors are not available as npm packages however, and sometimes have dependencies on web-specific
utilities. Because of this, the `@theoplayer/react-native-drm` package provides
the following connectors, readily available to be used by `react-native-theoplayer`:

| Vendor                       | Widevine    | Playready   | FairPlay |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| BuyDRM KeyOS                 | &check;     | &check;     | &check;  |
| EZDRM                        | &check; (*) | &check; (*) | &check;  |
| Verimatrix MultiDRM Core DRM | &check;     | &check;     | &check;  |
| Anvato                       | &check;     | &cross;     | &check;  |
| Axinom                       | &check;     | &cross;     | &check;  |
| CastLabs                     | &check;     | &check;     | &check;  |
| PallyCon                     | &cross;     | &cross;     | &check;  |

(*) No connector is needed for these DRM vendors; it is handled by the player's default DRM flow.
